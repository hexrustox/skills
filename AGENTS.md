This repo authors agent skills and packages them as a Claude Code plugin.

## Skills
- When adding or renaming an authored skill, register it in the `skills` array of `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with its plugin-root-relative path under `./skills/`.
- `.agents/skills/` and `skills-lock.json` belong to the `skills` CLI; do not edit them by hand.
- When writing or modifying a skill (new or existing), load the `writing-for-agents` skill and read `docs/agents/spec.md` and `docs/agents/best-practices.md`.

## Verification
After editing a skill, run `validate-skill <path to SKILL.md>`.
